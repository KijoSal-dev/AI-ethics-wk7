# AI-ethics-wk7

## Overview

This project explores ethical issues and fairness in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, with a focus on practical analysis and reflection. It includes hands-on experiments using the COMPAS dataset and the AI Fairness 360 library, as well as an ethical reflection on developing AI-powered task management applications.

## Key Features

- **Bias Audit with COMPAS Dataset:**  
  The project uses the AI Fairness 360 library to audit the COMPAS dataset for racial bias and fairness. Metrics such as Disparate Impact and False Positive Rate Disparity are computed, visualized, and discussed.

- **Fairness Metrics & Remediation:**  
  The analysis covers both group fairness (e.g., disparate impact) and error rate fairness (e.g., false positive rates). Various remediation strategies are discussed, including preprocessing, in-processing, and post-processing techniques to improve fairness in AI models.

- **Ethical Reflection on AI Applications:**  
  The project includes a detailed ethical reflection on building AI-enabled task management tools. It addresses critical concerns such as:
  - **Privacy & Data Protection:** Ensuring user data is secure, encrypted, and under user control.
  - **Fairness & Avoiding Bias:** Designing algorithms that do not favor or disadvantage certain users or tasks.
  - **Transparency & Explainability:** Providing clear explanations for AI decisions.
  - **User Autonomy:** Allowing users to override AI suggestions and maintain control.
